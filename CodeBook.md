## Project Description

I. Project assignment:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will 
be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

You will be required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set as described below, 

2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable 
computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and 
Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new 
users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from 
the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is 
available at the site where the data was obtained:
